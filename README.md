# Note Taker Application

## Description
This is a project to make a simple backend connection for an already designed and working front-end UI. The overall goal is to have a note-taker application that can store notes and delete notes depending on the user's intention.
</br>

## Usage
The user would go to this app to enter notes for whatever their needs are. The app will store the notes and the notes can be deleted by the user.
</br>

## Visuals
The index.html landing page was predefined and coded for this project ahead of time.

A majority of the design of the notes.html was also predefined and coded for this project ahead of time.
